This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Ada programming: array index out-of-bounds exceptions. Ada, unlike some languages, does not perform automatic bounds checking. This means that attempting to access an array element using an index outside the defined range will not necessarily result in a compiler error but rather a runtime exception.  The example showcases a scenario where improper array handling can cause unexpected crashes. The solution provides a safer approach by explicitly checking array bounds before accessing elements.
